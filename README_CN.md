## Performance

<p align="center">

</p>

Performance comparison of our method against the baseline and competing approaches.
+ We systematically analyze how hierarchical visual features influence LVLM
performance across diverse task categories. Our findings reveal that different
layers of the vision encoder play distinct roles, emphasizing the necessity of
task-aware feature fusion rather than static fusion strategies.
+ We propose an instruction-guided vision aggregator, which dynamically assigns
fusion weights to hierarchical visual features based on task-specific instructions.
This mechanism enables LVLMs to selectively emphasize task-relevant features,
improving adaptability without increasing the number of visual tokens.
+ We integrate the proposed vision aggregator into the LLaVA-v1.5 framework,
achieving significant improvements over the baseline and surpassing existing
hierarchical visual feature fusion methods as well as similarly scaled LVLMs

## Framework

The overall framework is illustrated. It consists of four main modules: a vision encoder $V$, a vision-language adapter $ADP$, an instruction-guided vision aggregator $\mathit{IGVA}$, and an LLM. For demonstration purposes, we use the widely adopted LLaVA-v1.5  as the implementation framework.

![Overview of the proposed framework.](images/Framework.png)

**Vision Encoder**  
We use CLIP-ViT as the vision encoder. It divides an input image $\mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}$ into small patches and processes the patch sequence through a stack of transformer layers. The hierarchical output of the vision encoder is:

```math
\mathbf{F} = V(\mathbf{I}) \in \mathbb{R} ^ {L \times (N+1) \times D},
```

where $L$ is the number of transformer layers, $N$ is the number of patches, and $D$ is the hidden dimension. Each layer produces $N+1$ features, as a `<cls>` token is prepended to the patch sequence to aggregate global information.

---

**Instruction-guided Vision Aggregator**  
The key innovation of our method is the vision aggregator, which dynamically integrates hierarchical visual features based on task instructions. We divide the $L$ layers of the vision encoder into $K$ groups, each containing $L/K$ consecutive layers. For each group, average pooling is applied to the `<cls>` hidden states to obtain a group-wise global feature:

```math
\mathbf{F}^{cls}_{k} = \mathit{Avg}(\mathbf{cls}_{k_1}, \mathbf{cls}_{k_2}, ..., \mathbf{cls}_{k_{L/K}}) \in \mathbb{R}^{ D}, \quad \text{for } k = 1, 2, ..., K,
```

where $\mathbf{cls}_{k_i} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$ is the `<cls>` feature of the i-th layer in group $k$. The aggregator comprises a sentence embedding model and a weight allocator. The sentence embedding model encodes the textual instruction into a semantic embedding $\mathbf{s}$, which is passed to the weight allocator to compute the importance of each visual group:

```math
\mathbf{w} = \mathit{IGVA}(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{F}^{cls}_{1}, \mathbf{F}^{cls}_{2}, ..., \mathbf{F}^{cls}_{K}) \in \mathbb{R}^{K}, \quad \text{where } \sum_{k=1}^K w_k = 1.
```

For each group, we apply average pooling to the patch features. Then, we perform weighted summation across the pooled features using the weight vector $\mathbf{w}$:

```math
\mathbf{F}^{patch}_k = \mathit{Avg}(\mathbf{F}^{patch}_{k_1}, \mathbf{F}^{patch}_{k_2}, ..., \mathbf{F}^{patch}_{k_{L/K}}) \in \mathbb{R} ^ {N \times D}, \quad \text{for } k = 1, ..., K.
```

```math
\mathbf{F}_{fused} = \sum_{k=1}^K w_k \times \mathbf{F}^{patch}_k \in \mathbb{R} ^ {N \times D},
```

where $\mathbf{F}^{patch}_{k_i} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$ represents the patch features of the i-th layer in group $k$. Finally, to preserve semantic richness, the fused features are concatenated with the penultimate layer‚Äôs features to form the final visual representation:

```math
\hat{\mathbf{F}} = \mathit{Concate}(\mathbf{F}_{fused}, \mathbf{F}_{penultimate}) \in \mathbb{R} ^ {N \times 2D}.
```

---

**Vision-Language Adapter**  
The vision-language adapter aligns the final visual representation with the embedding space of the LLM. It consists of a two-layer MLP with a GELU activation function:

```math
ADP(\hat{\mathbf{F}}) = \mathit{Proj}_2(\mathit{GELU}(\mathit{Proj}_1(\hat{\mathbf{F}}))) \in \mathbb{R} ^ {N \times D_t},
```

where $D_t$ is the hidden dimension of the LLM.

---

**Large Language Model**  
The LLM first tokenizes the textual instruction and computes embeddings for each token. These text embeddings are then concatenated with the aligned visual features along the sequence dimension. The resulting combined sequence is processed through a stack of transformer layers, ultimately generating a textual response.

## Evaluate
### VQA benchmarks
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/VQA.png" width="90%"></a>
</p>

Performance comparison on mainstream image-based VQA benchmarks. Bold values
indicate the best score in each row, while underlined values represent the second-best score.


Table presents a comparison of our method with the baseline and two existing hi-
erarchical visual feature fusion approaches across 10 image-based VQA benchmarks,
including 6 LVLM-specific benchmarks and 4 traditional VQA datasets.
On LVLM-specific benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms the baseline
and consistently surpasses existing fusion methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in
leveraging hierarchical visual information tailored to different tasks. On traditional
VQA benchmarks, our method achieves the highest scores on SQA, TextVQA, and
VizWiz. While our approach surpasses both the baseline and MMFuser on GQA, it
slightly underperforms DenseConnector. Since GQA is designed for compositional
reasoning, the textual questions contain complex linguistic structures , which
may challenge the sentence embedding model in accurately capturing task-relevant
information. This, in turn, may hinder the vision aggregator from deriving optimal
feature-weighting distributions.

### Visual Grounding and Video Understanding
<p align="center">

</p>

Performance comparison on visual grounding and video understanding benchmarks. For
visual grounding, the score of each benchmark is averaged across val and test splits. Bold values
indicate the best score in each column, while underlined values represent the second-best score.

Table presents the results for visual grounding, where our
method consistently achieves the highest scores across all benchmarks. This high-lights its effectiveness in enhancing object-region alignment across diverse image
contexts. The right section of table 5 reports the results for video understanding.
Apart from ActivityNet-QA, where our method achieves performance on par with
DenseConnector, it surpasses both the baseline and DenseConnector across all other
video benchmarks. This demonstrates that our method captures richer task-related
visual representations, which is crucial for modeling temporal dynamics and contex-tual dependencies across video frames.

### Visual Representation Visualization

To intuitively validate the impact of MMFuser on visual features, we present the input and output feature map visualizations for four example images in the figure.
